    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I am an Exercise Physiology major at the University of Miami,
      minoring in Psychology, with hands-on experience supporting
      sport science operations for a Division I football program.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic and professional interests sit at the intersection of
      sport science, sports medicine, and data analytics. I am particularly
      interested in how objective data and evidence-based practice can
      enhance athlete performance, recovery, and long-term health.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through internships, research exposure, and independent projects,
      I have developed a strong interest in applied sport science roles
      that value collaboration, curiosity, and athlete-centered care.
