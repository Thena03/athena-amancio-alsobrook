In collaboration with the University of Miami School of Education and Human Development, ST Sicily, and the CSMT Innovation Hub, my partner Stella York and I evaluated the agricultural software Sandy. The platform is designed to calculate carbon emissions for European farms by analyzing key variables such as tillage methods, soil types, and crop choices. 
<br><br>
Our work involved testing and analyzing the software to understand its capabilities and limitations, translating technical data into actionable insights that could support more sustainable farming practices across the region.

      Cross-Cultural Research
    </h2> <br>
<p class="text-slate-700 max-w-4xl mb-8">
Under the leadership of Associate Dean EllenMarie McPhillip and Vice Dean Soyeon Ahn, I was selected as one of five students to take part in an immersive cross-cultural research experience in Brescia, Italy. This experience was designed to explore whether learning research through real-world application meaningfully transforms how students understand and engage with research methods.
<br><br>
Throughout the Spring 2025 semester, we learned research by applying the tools we learned in real time. We developed our own research questions, refined methodologies, and built analytical skills directly in the classroom. When we traveled to Brescia, we carried these tools with us, applying them to questions posed by Northern Italian organizations and corporations. Working across cultural and professional contexts, we translated classroom theory into practice, using research to inform decision-making and create tangible value for our partners.

Using Excel, R programming, and Canva (for visual design), my partner Stella and I worked with RuRall to evaluate a potential partnership with the agricultural software company Sandy focused on sustainable farming in Brescia, Italy. Our role centered on transforming raw data into insights that could guide strategic decisions.
<br><br>
By creating data visualizations in R with the ggplot2 package, we communicated sustainability trends and carbon reduction considerations in a clear and compelling way. This work ultimately reached a broader audience when RuRall’s data scientist featured our visualizations in a presentation on carbon reduction strategies in Venice, Italy, demonstrating how student-led research can drive meaningful, real-world impact.
