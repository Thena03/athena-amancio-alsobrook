    </h1>

The Hult Prize is one of the world’s largest student entrepreneurship competitions, empowering university students to develop innovative, scalable solutions to pressing global challenges. Often referred to as the “Nobel Prize for Students,” the competition aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and awards $1 million USD in seed funding to the global winning team.

As Campus Director at the University of Miami, I lead the official campus competition and oversee the strategic execution of all programming associated with the initiative.

<p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl">
This year marks a historic milestone as the University of Miami School of Education and Human Development hosts the Hult Prize for the first time. Bringing this globally recognized entrepreneurship platform into SEHD expands the School’s reach into innovation, venture creation, and interdisciplinary problem solving.

Hosting the Hult Prize within SEHD redefines the traditional boundaries of education by positioning the School as a hub for social entrepreneurship, leadership development, and impact-driven innovation.
